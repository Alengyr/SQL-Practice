# SQL-Practice
For practicing github alongside SQL with Nalzeth

Premise of modifying the entire database is for simulating an environment where there is high volume of csv files to be imported into SQL Server.
Scripts will be to discover ways to perform basic ETL based on requirements in comments within Main.

Query formatting: 
-Since this is meant as practice, capitalization of functions for readability not required. (No need to follow convention)

Comment guidelines: 
-Queries that are completed and parsed with intended results to have (DONE) appended at the end, on top of the query.
-Queries that parsed with unintended consequences must be carefully doumented in comment.
